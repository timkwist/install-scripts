# Terminal Setup Script

This repository contains a script that sets up an enhanced terminal environment with powerful CLI tools and productivity enhancements.

## Usage

Simply run the setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

After running, restart your terminal or run:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## What It Does

The setup script:

1. Checks for zsh and oh-my-zsh installation
2. Creates a backup of your existing .zshrc
3. Installs Homebrew if not already installed
4. Allows selective installation of tool categories:
   - Core utilities (fzf, eza, bat, ripgrep, fd)
   - Navigation tools (tldr, direnv)
   - Development tools (httpie, tmux)
   - Git tools (lazygit, git-delta)
   - System monitoring (bottom, glances)
   - ZSH plugins (autosuggestions, syntax-highlighting)
   - Applications (rectangle)
5. Checks for Node.js/npm before installing npm packages
6. Configures FZF keybindings and completion
7. Installs global NPM tools (trash-cli)
8. Updates your `.zshrc` with necessary configurations
9. Adds useful ZSH plugins (git, brew, node, npm, fzf, history, macos, docker, pip, python, vscode, extract)
10. Sets a timestamp in your prompt
11. Safely adds aliases without overwriting existing ones
